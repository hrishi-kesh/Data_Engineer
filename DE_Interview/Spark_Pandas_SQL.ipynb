        "#1. What is spark architecture?\n",
        "\"\"\"Apache Spark Architecture:\n",
        "1. Driver: The driver is the main control process that creates the SparkContext, connects to the cluster, and coordinates the execution of tasks. It translates the user program into tasks and schedules them to run on executors.\n",
        "2. Executors: Executors are worker nodes that run individual tasks in a distributed manner. Each executor has its own JVM and runs tasks assigned by the driver. Executors also provide in-memory storage for RDDs that are cached by user programs through SparkContext.\n",
        "3. Cluster Manager: The cluster manager is responsible for managing the resources across the cluster. Spark supports various cluster managers like Standalone, Apache Mesos, kubernates and Hadoop YARN. The cluster manager allocates resources to the driver and executors.\n",
        "4. RDD (Resilient Distributed Dataset): RDD is the fundamental data structure of Spark. It is an immutable distributed collection of objects that can be processed in parallel. RDDs support two types of operations: transformations (e.g., map, filter) and actions (e.g., count, collect).\n",
        "5. DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph): Spark creates a logical execution plan in the form of a DAG. The DAG represents the sequence of transformations applied to the data. The DAG scheduler divides the operators into stages of tasks and submits them to the task scheduler.\n",
        "6. Task Scheduler: The task scheduler is responsible for scheduling tasks on the executors. It takes the stages from the DAG scheduler and assigns tasks to executors based on data locality and resource availability.\n",
        "In summary, Spark architecture consists of a driver, executors, cluster manager, RDDs, DAG, and task scheduler, working together to process large-scale data in a distributed and fault-tolerant manner.\n",
        "\"\"\"\n",
        "\n",
        "#How does Spark distribute tasks for processing a 1 GB file, and how are tasks and executors allocated during execution?\n",
        "'''Spark divides the 1 GB file into partitions (default is 128 MB per partition for HDFS), creating about 8 partitions for a 1 GB file. Each partition becomes a task.\n",
        "\n",
        "Executors: Each executor processes multiple tasks based on available cores.\n",
        "Tasks per Executor: If an executor has 4 cores, it can run 4 tasks in parallel.'''\n",
        "\n",
        "# What is spark-submit explain in details?\n",
        "'''\n",
        "spark-submit is a command-line tool used to launch Spark applications on a cluster or locally. It handles resource allocation, configuration, and submission of jobs to Spark clusters like YARN, Kubernetes, Mesos, or standalone mode.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Responsibilities:\n",
        "Distribute Application Code: Sends your Spark application JAR or Python script to the cluster.\n",
        "Resource Management: Allocates memory and CPU resources for the driver and executors.\n",
        "Configuration Management: Sets properties like application name, Spark master, deploy mode, and more.\n",
        "Job Execution: Manages the execution of tasks and monitors job progress.\n",

        "--num-executors\tNumber of executors to launch\n",
        "--conf\tSet configuration properties (e.g., spark.executor.memory)\n",
