    "Although we have workflows then why delta live table is required to run job\n",
    "ChatGPT said:\n",
    "Delta Live Tables (DLT) is required to run jobs efficiently because it simplifies data pipeline management compared to traditional workflows. Here’s why DLT is beneficial despite having workflows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Declarative Pipeline Definition\n",
    "Workflows require manual orchestration (e.g., scheduling, dependencies, error handling).\n",
    "DLT allows defining transformations declaratively using SQL or Python, and Databricks manages the execution.\n",
    "2. Built-in Data Quality Checks\n",
    "Workflows do not enforce data quality; you must write custom validation scripts.\n",
    "DLT provides expectations to enforce data quality rules and automatically handle bad records.\n",
    "3. Automatic Scaling & Optimization\n",
    "Workflows require manual tuning of Spark jobs and cluster configurations.\n",
    "DLT optimizes resource usage, caching, and incremental processing.\n",
    "4. Incremental Processing (CDC)\n",
    "Workflows typically process full datasets, which can be inefficient.\n",
    "DLT supports Change Data Capture (CDC) to process only new or changed records.\n",
    "5. Simplified Dependency Management\n",
    "Workflows require explicitly defining dependencies between tasks.\n",
    "DLT automatically tracks dependencies between tables and ensures correct execution order.\n",
    "6. Data Lineage & Observability\n",
    "Workflows require separate monitoring/logging setups.\n",
    "DLT provides built-in lineage tracking, logging, and monitoring in the Databricks UI.\n",
    "7. Error Handling & Recovery\n",
    "Workflows fail if errors occur and need manual intervention.\n",
    "DLT automatically retries failed tasks and allows rollback in case of failures.\n",
    "When to Use DLT Over Workflows?\n",
    "If you need real-time or near real-time processing.\n",
    "If you want automated error handling and retries.\n",
    "If you need built-in data quality enforcement.\n",
    "If you want simplified management without manually orchestrating jobs.\n",
    "When to Use Workflows Instead?\n",
    "If you have a custom orchestration logic with many external system integrations.\n",
    "If your job is not data transformation-heavy (e.g., file movements).\n",
    "Would you like a practical example comparing both? 🚀\n",
    "\n",
    "You said:\n",
    "DLT provides expectations to enforce data quality rules and automatically handle bad records.\n",
    "\n",
    "show in in detail or image where it is doing data quality, what kind of data quality it is doing?\n",
    "ChatGPT said:\n",
    "Delta Live Tables (DLT) Data Quality Management – Expectations & Handling Bad Records\n",
    "DLT provides expectations that allow users to enforce data quality rules within a pipeline. These expectations help validate and filter out bad records based on predefined rules, ensuring that only high-quality data is processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "1️⃣ How DLT Enforces Data Quality?\n",
    "DLT expectations are declarative constraints defined in SQL or Python. These rules: ✅ Check for missing values\n",
    "✅ Validate data types & format\n",
    "✅ Ensure referential integrity\n",
    "✅ Filter out bad records or send them to quarantine tables\n",
    "\n",
    "2️⃣ Types of Data Quality Checks in DLT\n",
    "✅ Basic Constraints\n",
    "Check for NULL values\n",
    "Ensure data types are correct\n",
    "Validate length constraints (e.g., phone numbers)\n",
    "✅ Business Rules\n",
    "Ensure age is within a valid range\n",
    "Validate email format\n",
    "Check if order amount is positive\n",
    "✅ Referential Integrity\n",
    "Ensure customer IDs exist in the master table\n",
    "Validate foreign key constraints\n",
    "3️⃣ Example: DLT Expectations in Action\n",
    "🔹 Python API Example\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy\n",
    "Edit\n",
    "from dlt import expect, create_table\n",
    "\n",
    "@dlt.table(\n",
    "  name=\"orders_cleaned\",\n",
    "  comment=\"Filtered orders with valid amounts\",\n",
    "  table_properties={\"quality\": \"silver\"}\n",
    ")\n",
    "@dlt.expect(\"valid_order_amount\", \"order_amount > 0\")\n",
    "@dlt.expect_or_fail(\"non_null_customer_id\", \"customer_id IS NOT NULL\")\n",
    "def clean_orders():\n",
    "    return spark.read.format(\"delta\").load(\"dbfs:/mnt/orders_raw\")\n",
    "📌 Explanation:\n",
    "1️⃣ order_amount > 0 → Filters out negative or zero amounts.\n",
    "2️⃣ customer_id IS NOT NULL → Rejects rows where customer ID is missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 SQL API Example\n",
    "sql\n",
    "Copy\n",
    "Edit\n",
    "CREATE LIVE TABLE orders_cleaned\n",
    "COMMENT \"Filtered orders with valid amounts\"\n",
    "TBLPROPERTIES (\"quality\" = \"silver\")\n",
    "AS \n",
    "SELECT *, \n",
    "  EXPECT(order_amount > 0) AS valid_order_amount,\n",
    "  EXPECT(customer_id IS NOT NULL) AS non_null_customer_id\n",
    "FROM LIVE.orders_raw;\n",
    "📌 Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "This adds data quality checks while processing the raw table orders_raw.\n",
    "Invalid records can be filtered or sent to an error table.\n",
    "4️⃣ Where Can You See Data Quality in DLT UI?\n",
    "🔹 DLT Pipeline UI in Databricks has a Data Quality Tab where you can:\n",
    "✅ See failed expectations with counts\n",
    "✅ View error reasons & rejected records\n",
    "✅ Monitor successful vs. failed records"
