Switch Between SQL and PL/SQL use click on task bar of vscode select sql for ms sql and plsql for oracle
Use ctrl+shift+p

1.Tools Required:- Python include(pip install pandas sqlalchemy),  sql server, Jypyter notebook download using pip we can use all these in vscode. And pip install pyodbc(install odbc driver as well)

2. Handling foreign character {It is not yet correct due to some issue}
2.1 like japanese which is non asci char so in datatype we define nvarchar instead of varchar and also change the column size to whatever max length of characters.
2.2 If there is null in that column then in jupyter use max(df.column_name.dropna().str.len()) which is remove then count the length

3. Removing of Duplicates 

-- new table for listed in, director, country, cast

-- data type conversions for date added
-- populate missing values in country, duration columns
-- populate rest of the nulls as not_available
-- drop columns director , listed_in, country, cast
